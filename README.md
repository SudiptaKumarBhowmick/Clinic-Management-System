# Clinic Management System
### Clinic Management System portal allows patients to visit the clinic and get registered and make an appointment by selecting the populated available doctors, which in turn lists the upcoming appointments for the selected doctor. By default, the appointment gets a pending status because it needs to be reviewed. After that, the doctor is going to work out the patient attendance. Under the report, we should have daily and monthly appointments.
